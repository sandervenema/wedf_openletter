            <p>{% blocktrans %}This Open Suggestion is written by the actual builders, collaborators, users, and stakeholders who have seen the value and damage Artificial Intelligence (AI) can deliver firsthand. We aim to set a healthy tone for the industry while making the process understandable by the public to illuminate the steps that should be taken to build more ethical AI. Now more than ever, it's necessary to open up the process so we can all have a voice at the table and hold each other accountable without severely restricting innovation.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}AI has transformed the way we connect, learn, live, and work but now we're seeing many doomerism narratives that are being used to obfuscate the structures of AI instead of focusing on clear, accountable communication that enables honest discussion. The creation of AI can be a technically dense process but the standard systems that people use to teach machines and the outputs the machines create can be monitored and validated in a simple framework that enables everyone to have a seat at the table regardless of your data science background. As policy makers frantically race to catch-up with regulation and the EU AI Act signals it may add GPAI (General Purpose AI) to the high risk category, we are here to set an actionable standard every team can use immediately that also clarifies how AI is built so we can reduce silos and discuss as a group. Instead of an Open Letter, this is an Open Suggestion from a group of experienced technologists, data scientists, researchers, journalists, and people concerned with the impact of AI.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <h2>{% trans "Intentionality is Imperative" %}</h2>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}The development of AI has the potential to bring about significant benefits, including
            increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and the ability to tackle problems that were previously impossible to solve. However, AI also has the ability to force human moderators to witness horrible content, disadvantaged the disenfranchised, amplify data privacy and safety concerns, steal intellectual property not created for the process, and perpetuate biases that cause harm.  Without careful consideration and planning, we risk creating AI systems that worsen the very problems we seek to solve.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <h2>{% trans "Intentional AI - Step Report" %}</h2>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}These are the first questions and considerations we believe every AI team and individual builder should take everyday to ensure we are releasing more ethical AI models. They are intended to be communicated in simple language without technical jargon to ensure the steps and logic can be understood by every audience and will be transacted over time to every local human language where we can find volunteers to support. We will not get it right as human processes must iterate when working with machines that learn. This is V1, the first version of questions to check ourselves and will one day be V29402910 as we refine the list to capture the appropriate steps that should be taken to clarify and validate our intentions alongside technology that is constantly evolving.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}This Open Suggestion will live as a forum, and we welcome new suggestions and approaches under the important banner of registering intent. The steps are isolated based on the core elements of building AI (Training, Creating, Testing) and the actors who engage in the process to help clarify the importance of silo reduction: Me, We, It.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}Me - The questions each individual who is working on the AI should ask themselves before they start and as they work through the process.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}We - The questions the group should ask themselves and define the diversity required to reduce as much human bias as possible.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}It - The questions we should ask individuals and the group as they relate to the model being created and the impact it can have on our world.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
